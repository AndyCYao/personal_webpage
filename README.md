# Andy's Personal Webpage
This is the source code for my personal webpage. I followed [this post](https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2012/dead-easy-yet-powerful-static-website-generator-with-flask/) for the guideline. 

I am going to be using all I have learned in CMPT 470 (Web Information System) to make this website.
