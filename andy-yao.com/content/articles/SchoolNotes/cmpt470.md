# Telnet HTTP Conversations
Uses the Transmission control Protocol (TCP) to communicate. 

It has serious security concern since uses open network. so secure shell (SSH) is favored now. 

Because:
- Telnet does not encrypt data sent over connection. so its possible to eavesdrop using packet analyzer. 
- Has no implementation of authentication.
