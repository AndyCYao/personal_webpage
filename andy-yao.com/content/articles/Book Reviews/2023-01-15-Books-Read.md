### The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York - Robert Caro
This was a great book, it took me almost the whole year to finish all one thousand pages. It is surprising to learn there were people like Robert Moses in the past. He must be what Walter White of Breaking Bad was based on. The most memorable thing for me was how successful Moses was at completing/obtaining the things he set out to achieve, through any means necessary. and how ruthless he was to his brother. 

### Fire and Blood - George R.R Martin 
I began to read this after finishing season 1 of House of the Dragon. I thought the TV show was much better since the show was able to expand on the latter section of the book. The show made the story much better. When I read the book I couldn't believe how imaginative Martin is 

### All You Need To Know About the Music Business - Donald S Passman
Great book, it was written in a conversational tone and it told a high-level view of the music industry from every participant's POV. 

### Pachinko - Min Jin Lee
This was another book I read while finishing season 1 of the Apple show. I thought the show was much better due to the cinematography 

### One Man's View Of The World - Lee Kuan Yew
I visited Singapore in May, it was so beautiful and advanced, and everywhere there was Lee's legacy. The most interesting thing to me was I thought he spoke Mandarin all his life, but it turned out he only learned mandarin when he was 35 years old. 

### The Things They Carried - Tim O'Brien
This is a fiction about a squadron of American soldiers serving in Vietnam, I didn't find it very memorable. 

### The World For Sale - Javier Blas, Jack Farchy
This is a great book about the world of commodity trading. It tells the evolution of commodities traders and their extravagances and downfalls. 

### Invisible Child - Andrea Elliot
I liked this book, it reminded me of the documentary `Hoop Dreams`, of a documentarian recording the lives of at-risk youths in inner-city America. I learned about the Hershey School for low-income kids from this book. What a great social service. 

### The Bond King - Mary Childs
This was recommended by the Planet Money podcast, about the rise and fall of PIMCO, the bond trading company.

### Mine! - Michael Heller, James Salzman 
This book was really fun to read, it tells about the evolution of laws in America, and most importantly the interpretation and enforcement are based on the standards of the day. 

### Flash Boys Not So Fast - Peter Kovac
As the title says, this book is a counterpoint to `Flash Boys` by Michael Lewis, it provided an insider view of high frequency trading, along with clearing up the misconceptions, great book. 

### The Narrative of the Life of Frederik Douglas - Frederik Douglas
This is an important book from one of the most important people in America. Even though his story has been told many times on PBS and in different media, I am glad to have read it.
