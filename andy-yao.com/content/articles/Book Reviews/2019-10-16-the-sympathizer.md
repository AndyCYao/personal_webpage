title: The Sympathizer
status: draft

This book won the Pulitzer Award for fiction in 2016, so I had high hopes for it, it started so intriguingly. The protagonist described in vivid detail of his life in the days before the fall of Saigon. But eventually it just got really boring. Towards the middle / end of the book, it became hard to continue, there was no plot movement.


### What I liked about
- The story is one of the few stories to be told from an Asian perspective. It is written similar to how white authors have written about Asia, for example, in many white focused books, the asians are demoted to nameless peasants / soldiers.

- This is the first time I read a vietnamese story. The lives of these Vietnamese men are not too different from the lives of Chinese men.

### Good Quotes
“If youth was not wasted, how could it be youth?”
“Remember, you're not half of anything, you're twice of everything.” (on the protagonist being a half vietnamese, and half white as he is reminded by his mother)
