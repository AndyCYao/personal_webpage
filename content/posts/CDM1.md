For my last semester in school, I am taking a special research project working with the master students at [Center of Digital Media](https://thecdm.ca/)

Our first project has just finished. Our client was a Vancouver dance company that was looking to show an augmented reality (AR) performance by one of their dancer. The dance would be activated by opening the app, and pointing the user's phone camera on the company logo.

## Journal

__Week 1__

- Experimented with unity, added placeholder dance model, stage and music
- Motion captured the dancers in the 3D animation studio.

- created two version of AR view for client's review:
- one locks the camera view to the front of the stage to capture the proscenium idea of theatre.
- one allows free movement of camera.

The latter was approved

- begin adding states to the project to handle the different phases of the app ie. Introduction phase, looking for marker phase, dancing phase, credit phase, etc.
- added in the raw fire dancer choreography animation and music. 

__Week 2__

- New Feature, allowing users to interact with the dance by tapping on the stage to pause or resume. 
- The water dance is chosen for minimal viable product (MVP). 
- Locked camera to portrait view. 
- Add and tweaked stage model
- Added cleaned-up animation and assets.
- Cleaned up non-essential files.

### Personal Lesson Learn
Through this project I had an introduction to Unity, C#, and Vuforia AR package. We developed the app using the state machine pattern.
