Pancake Flipping Robot -> close world, only one action 

AI falls in four categories

__Think Humanly__
comparing with thinking in humans, construct the working of human mind.


__Think Rationally__
what are correct arguments, and various logics


__Acting Humanly__
like google home, siri, etc. parsing answers from voice


__Acting Rationally__
rational behaviour -- doing the right thing.

the Mars rover had autnomous planning and scheduling 

thinking vs acting, bacterias, are reacting from stimulus, and then act, but its hard to claim they are thinking. 

so acting does not always require thinking
	- instinct
	- reflexs like blinking
	- insects, Siri, Watson? 

what are the advantages of thinking? why thinking animal have evolved? 
- so we can deal with new situations. (maybe stimulus is preprogrammed) so flexibility
- planning vs reacting 
- inventions
- Flexibility
- Robustness



### What is intelligent system
anything that can be viewed as preceiving its environment through sensors, and acting upon the environment through actuators.

our human agents are : eyes ears for sensors, and our actuators are our limbs

robot agents are : cameras, range finders for snesors, and wheels motor for actuators.

agent function maps from percept histories to actions

the agent program runs on the physical architecture to produce the behaviour f

agent = architecture + program

in the case of self driving car -> the __agent__ function says if theres person in front of you, (__percept__) then maps to the __action__  of stopping the car.
