### History of Programming Languages
Programming languages are developed organically based on the developer's needs. 

The three most influential languages were Fortran, LISP, and COBOL

__Fortran__ (1957), stands for Formula Translator, was the first language to incorporate variables, before this it was machine languages. John Backus developed this with engineering and science users in mind. Fortran is still actively used today.

__LISP__ (1958), stands for list processing, developed by John McCarthy is a language with a simple core, developed with math users in mind. 

__COBOL__ (1950's), asscoiated with Grace Hoppe, for business users, stands for Common Business Oriented Language. 

we briefly mentioned the below languages 

__Algol__ (1960's), was another pioneer language, but was not heavily adopted.

__SmallTalk__ (1970's), asscoiated with Alan Kay and XEROX parc, help popularized object oriented programming in North America. inspired by Simula and LISP

__Prolog__ (1970's), developed with logic in mind, for AI and parsing English, syntax is based on first order logic. 

### Ways to Organize Languages:
__Declarative vs Procedural__

Declarative languages like markup, SQL, prolog.

Procedural languages like Von Neuman (C Ada Fortran) , Object Oriented (java, smalltalk), or Script (python ruby perl)

__Compiled vs Interpretted__

Compiled programs (C, Fortran) are very efficient, compilers can find errors before program is run, and it can do static analysis (checking something against the soruce code)

Interpretted programs (like Python, LISP) are good for fast development, allow codes to be created on the fly, but it is slower than compiled codes
